## Count ways to N'th Stair

## Intuition
The `countWays` function calculates the number of ways to reach the nth stair when the order doesn't matter.

## Approach

**Base Case** : If there's only one stair or none, there's only one way to reach it.

- For each additional stair :
   - I can either take one step.
   - Or skip the stair if `n` is even (since order doesn't matter).

- Thus, the total ways to reach the nth stair is `(n / 2) + 1`.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

## Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(1)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O())$$ -->

- Space complexity : $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code

```
//  User function Template for Java

class Solution {

    // Function to count the number of ways to reach the nth stair
    // when the order does not matter.

    Long countWays(int n) {

        // Base case: if there is only one stair or no stair, there is only one way to reach it.
        long ways = 1;

        // For each stair, I can either take one step or skip it (if n is even).
        // So, the number of ways to reach the nth stair is (n/2) + 1.
        // I add 1 to account for the possibility of not taking any steps.
        ways += (n / 2);

        // Returning the total number of ways.
        return ways;
    }
}
